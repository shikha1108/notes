### Microservice Architecture
Microlithic architecture is a modern architectural pattern that aims to decompose large-scale applications into smaller, manageable services, often referred to as microservices. Each microservice is an independent, self-contained unit responsible for a specific business capability. These services communicate via well-defined APIs, typically over HTTP or message queues.

### Monolithic Architecture
Monolithic architecture is the traditional approach to software design, where the entire application is developed as a single, tightly integrated unit. All components, modules, and functionalities are bundled together and deployed as a single application.

### Rest Api's 

Rest Api is a way of sharing information between two servers.
It has several methods 
* Get:It is used to retrieve data.
* Post:Its is used to post data to server.
* Patch:Applies partial modifications to a resource. It is often used to update specific fields of an existing resource.
* Put:Updates a specified resource with new data. It replaces the existing representation of the resource
* Delete: It is used to delete the data.

### Response status code.

When you interact with a RESTful API, the server responds with an HTTP status code to indicate the success or failure of the request.
These status codes are three-digit numbers that provide information about the status of the HTTP request.
* 200 OK, 
* 401 Unauthorized, 
* 400 Bad Request, 
* 404 Not Found, 
* 500 Internal Server Error 
* 503 Service Unavailable

### Null pointer Exception

 Null pointer exception is a runtime exception. Null is a special kind of value that can be assigned to the reference of an object. Whenever one tries to use a reference that has the Null value, the NullPointerException is raised.

 ```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    String name = null;
    System.out.println(name.length());
}
```
Here, the variable name is assigned the value null, and then we try to access the name , in result NullPointerException will come here.

* Compile time exception and run time exception.
