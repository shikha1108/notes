*  Null pointer Exception
```
 Null pointer exception is a runtime exception. Null is a special kind of value that can be assigned to the reference of an object. Whenever one tries to use a reference that has the Null value, the NullPointerException is raised.
 Example: 
     public static void main(String[] args) {
     	String name = null;
     	            System.out.println(name);

In the first example, the variable name is assigned the value null, and then we try to access the name , in result NullPointerException will come here.  	            

}
